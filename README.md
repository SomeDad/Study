# Study
My study journey from Detective Senior Constable to SOC Analyst, while trying to fit in work, two kids and my own life. 

**21/01/2022** - I decided in July, 2021 that I was going to work towards a career change into Cybersecurity. I didn't initially know what I wanted to do or any idea how to go about making the change, so I got in contact with a friend of my uncle who works in Cybersecurity in Dubai. He was absolutely amazing and spent time messaging and Skype calling me with advice and potential paths to take. I'm lucky that I spoke with him, because I nearly dropped $16k on a Monash Uni bootcamp that went for 24 weeks and I think only ended up getting you CompTIA Security+ and Network+.

I decided that I would go for Security+ first, as I already had some IT knowledge thanks to dad being an IT Consultant for my entire life. For Security+ I chose to do a Udemy course (Jason Dion) and do the exam. 

While studying for Security+ I joined a few Cybersecurity groups on Facebook, which then got me invited into a Slack study group and from there into my most helpful resource so far, the Slack (now Discord) group, Study Sessions with Butchy. Butchy (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenbartimote/) is a Cyber Security Consultant in who has created this group to help those either trying to get into, or new to Cybersecurity. Within the group there are a bunch of experienced professionals who provide guidance and specialised expertise, going out of their way to help with even the simplest questions. Butchy has also swung me a free CSI Linux OSINT course, which I haven't been able to properly put time into yet. 

To complement my study, I have been doing TryHackMe (THM) to practically learn more about Cybersecurity. I've paid for premium and I'm currently top 6% on THM. I've learnt a lot of Linux fundamentals, enumeration techniques and analysis tools. I also completed the entire Advent of Cyber 3; which is a Christmas event on THM where there is a new room every day that each teach you something different, from web exploitation, networking to cloud computing and blue teaming. 

I've also been doing some Blue Team Labs Online (BTLO) to practically learn how to investigate and defend against cyber attacks. I'm apparently top 20% in BTLO, but I haven't done much at this stage. I will get more into BTLO over the next few months to ensure that I'm able to actually do the SOC Analyst role instead of just having the knowledge from videos (Udemy). 

Another fun thing I've done is some CTF's, I haven't completely finished one yet but I have done OverTheWire's Bandit CTF to level 10 a few times. I've also saved the commands I used to a notepad to remember later on. At some point I aim to create a repository with commonly used commands for work / study / CTF's. 

I passed my Security+ exam on 21/12/2021 and started studying for CySA+ by doing another Udemy course with Jason Dion again. I'm still studying this at the moment and expect to have finished the course and to take the exam sometime within the next 3-4 months. 

During this time, I also decided to brush up more on my basic IT and networking knowledge, so when I have free time but not long enough to sit down for a solid chunk of time I've been going through the Network+ and A+ videos on Udemy by Mike Meyers. I really like how Mike Meyers teaches, he's a very visual teacher and explains everything very in-depth but also in lamens terms. 

Over the next few months I have set myself a goal to complete the CySA+ course and sit the exam, as well as to finish going through the entire Network+ and A+ video course (but not sit the exams). 

**26/01/2022** - I sat down and wrote a timeline for study, giving myself a practical amount of time to learn and practice different programs over the next few months while still being able to spend time with family. 

I watched a few "day in the life of a SOC Analyst" videos on Youtube, which really got me in the mood to learn more practically. I signed up to Splunk learning to do Splunk Fundamentals 1, which has now changed to a number of single-subject courses that break down specifc uses of Splunk into smaller video segments; Using Fields, Scheduling Reports and Alerts, etc.
