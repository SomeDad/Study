My study journey from Detective Senior Constable to SOC Analyst.

**21/01/2022** - I decided in July, 2021 that I was going to work towards a career change into Cybersecurity. I didn't initially know what I wanted to do or any idea how to go about making the change, so I got in contact with a friend of my uncle who works in Cybersecurity in Dubai. He was absolutely amazing and spent time messaging and Skype calling me with advice and potential paths to take. I'm lucky that I spoke with him, because I nearly dropped $16k on a Monash Uni bootcamp that went for 24 weeks and I think only ended up getting you CompTIA Security+ and Network+.

I decided that I would go for Security+ first, as I already had some IT knowledge thanks to dad being an IT Consultant for my entire life. For Security+ I chose to do a Udemy course (Jason Dion) and do the exam. 

While studying for Security+ I joined a few Cybersecurity groups on Facebook, which then got me invited into a Slack study group and from there into my most helpful resource so far, the Slack (now Discord) group, Study Sessions with Butchy. Butchy (https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenbartimote/) is a Cyber Security Consultant in who has created this group to help those either trying to get into, or new to Cybersecurity. Within the group there are a bunch of experienced professionals who provide guidance and specialised expertise, going out of their way to help with even the simplest questions. 

To complement my Security+ study, I have been doing TryHackMe (THM) to practically learn more about Cybersecurity. I'm currently top 6% on THM and I've learnt a lot of Linux fundamentals, enumeration techniques and analysis tools. I also completed the entire Advent of Cyber 3; which is a Christmas event on THM where there is a new room every day that each teach you something different, from web exploitation, networking to cloud computing and blue teaming.
